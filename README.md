###### <i>UC Berkeley MIDS `Data Visualization` Group Project</i>

The project utilizes tools such as Tableau, D3, Altair, and Bootstrap to offer a comprehensive view of the global impact of climate change. It focuses on four key performance indicators (KPIs): global temperature changes, sea level rise, financial and risk indicators for a low-carbon economy, and the financial and human toll of climate disasters. The aim is to enhance understanding of the climate crisis through effective visual storytelling.

For my individual contribution, I led the development of the [Financial and Risk Indicators](https://groups.ischool.berkeley.edu/ClimateVis/cfbl.html) section, featuring charts and graphs primarily created with Tableau. This section focuses on raising awareness of the carbon footprint of bank loans and evaluating countries' preparedness for a low-carbon transition, along with its impact on regional economic development. Additionally, I spearheaded the website development using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. My work included creating the header, footer, [Home page](https://groups.ischool.berkeley.edu/ClimateVis/index.html) with carousel features, [Overview page](https://groups.ischool.berkeley.edu/ClimateVis/overview.html), and designing a flexible layout for the remaining sections in the **INDICATORS** tab, enabling seamless integration of visualizations from teammates.
