# [Climate Change Dashboard](https://groups.ischool.berkeley.edu/ClimateVis/index.html)
###### <i>UC Berkeley MIDS `Data Visualization` Group Project</i>

The project utilizes tools such as Tableau, D3, Altair, and Bootstrap to offer a comprehensive view of the global impact of climate change. It focuses on four key performance indicators (KPIs): global temperature changes, sea level rise, financial and risk indicators for a low-carbon economy, and the financial and human toll of climate disasters. The aim is to enhance understanding of the climate crisis through effective visual storytelling.

For my individual contribution, I led the development of the [Financial and Risk Indicators](https://groups.ischool.berkeley.edu/ClimateVis/cfbl.html) section, which features charts and graphs primarily created with Tableau. The purpose of this section is to raise awareness of the carbon footprint of bank loans and the preparedness of countries for a low-carbon transition and its impact on regional economic development. Additionally, I spearheaded the website development, utilizing HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to integrate the team's visualizations across the remaining sections.
